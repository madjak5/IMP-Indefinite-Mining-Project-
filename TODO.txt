Planning for IMP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, let's just say this will take a bit, mainly due to being new to creating something other than a console program. Don't worry, it's not like this will be in assembly or something like that. (Although I'd like the speed boost from it)
May be updated every so often depending on what is needed.
For a list of things to do, we have:
-Game engine - If a lightweight solution is not available, I'll have to cobble one up.
-UI - Simple, and on the bottom and right sides of the player's view. Items go bottom, Stats go right.
-Controls - Should be easy to learn and understand. No complicated keystrokes to do basic tasks.
-Lotto blocks - The luck based fun of this game. Green Neon Lighting for the block.
-Suits - Heat suits and Radsuits to protect the player from the effects of the underground. Craftable and found randomly in generated structures.
-Structure generation - Abandoned mineshafts, bunkers, dungeon and homes, as well as a inactive reactor for serious loot
-Items - Pick, Axe, Shovel, and possible weaponry
